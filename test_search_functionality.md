# Search Functionality Test Guide

## üîß Testing the DataSnipper-Style Search Implementation

### 1. **Start Excel with the Add-in**
- Run: `.\start_excel_with_snipper.bat`
- This ensures the updated DLL is loaded with search functionality

### 2. **Open the Snipper Pro Document Viewer**
- Open Excel
- Click on the "Snipper Pro" tab in the ribbon
- Click "Open Viewer" button

### 3. **Load a PDF Document**
- In the Document Viewer, click "Load Document(s)"
- Select an IFRS PDF file (or any PDF with text)
- Wait for the document to load and text extraction to complete

### 4. **Test Search Functionality**

#### **Basic Search Test:**
1. Type "IFRS" in the search box
2. Press Enter or click the üîç button
3. **Expected Results:**
   - Status should show "Found X matches for 'IFRS'"
   - Yellow highlights should appear on the document
   - Current result should have orange highlight/border
   - Navigation buttons (‚óÄ ‚ñ∂) should be enabled
   - Results counter should show "1/X"

#### **Navigation Test:**
1. Click the ‚ñ∂ (next) button to cycle through results
2. Click the ‚óÄ (previous) button to go back
3. **Expected Results:**
   - Orange highlight should move to the next/previous result
   - Counter should update (e.g., "2/5", "3/5")
   - Viewport should center on the found text

#### **Keyboard Shortcuts Test:**
1. Press `Ctrl+F` - should focus the search box
2. Press `F3` - should go to next result
3. Press `Shift+F3` - should go to previous result
4. Press `Escape` - should close search mode

#### **Close Search Test:**
1. Click the ‚úï button
2. **Expected Results:**
   - All highlights should disappear
   - Search box should clear
   - Navigation buttons should be disabled

### 5. **Advanced Tests**

#### **Case Insensitive Search:**
- Search for "ifrs" (lowercase) - should still find "IFRS"
- Search for "Revenue" - should find "revenue", "REVENUE", etc.

#### **Partial Word Search:**
- Search for "Rev" - should find words containing "Revenue"
- Search for "15" - should find "IFRS 15"

#### **Cross-Document Search:**
- Load multiple PDF files
- Search for a term that appears in different documents
- Navigation should switch between documents automatically

### 6. **Visual Verification**

#### **Ribbon Icons:**
- Check that snip category buttons have colored squares:
  - Text Snip: Blue square with professional gradient
  - Sum Snip: Purple square
  - Table Snip: Purple square
  - Validation: Green square
  - Exception: Red square

#### **Search UI Elements:**
- Search box in the toolbar (second row)
- üîç search button
- ‚óÄ ‚ñ∂ navigation buttons
- Results counter label
- ‚úï close button

### 7. **Troubleshooting**

#### **If Search Doesn't Work:**
1. Check the status bar for error messages
2. Ensure the PDF loaded successfully
3. Try a simple search term like "a" or "the"
4. Check that text extraction completed (status should not show "Searching..." indefinitely)

#### **If No Highlights Appear:**
1. Ensure search found results (check status and counter)
2. Try zooming in/out to refresh the display
3. Check that the correct page is displayed

#### **If Highlights Are in Wrong Position:**
1. This is expected with the current implementation
2. The highlighting uses estimated text positions
3. Focus on verifying that searches work and navigation functions

### 8. **Log Verification**
- Check the application logs for search-related entries:
  - "Starting text extraction for search"
  - "Text extraction completed"
  - "Starting search for: '[term]'"
  - "FOUND '[term]' in word: '[word]'"
  - "Search completed. Found X total results"

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The search functionality is working correctly if:
1. ‚úÖ Search finds and counts results correctly
2. ‚úÖ Yellow highlights appear on the document
3. ‚úÖ Orange highlight marks the current result
4. ‚úÖ Navigation buttons cycle through results
5. ‚úÖ Keyboard shortcuts work (Ctrl+F, F3, etc.)
6. ‚úÖ Search can be closed with ‚úï or Escape
7. ‚úÖ Ribbon shows colored category squares
8. ‚úÖ Text extraction happens automatically on document load

This implementation provides a solid foundation for DataSnipper-style search functionality!
